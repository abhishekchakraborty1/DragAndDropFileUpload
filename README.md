Utilizes [`androidx.core`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/core)'s [`DragStartHelper`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/core/view/DragStartHelper) 
and [`androidx.draganddrop`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/draganddrop)'s [`DropHelper`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/draganddrop/DropHelper) to simplify
the process of implementing both dragging and dropping functionality.
